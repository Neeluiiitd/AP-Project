**Good programming practices**
All the fields in the class should be private unless there is a good reason to have otherwise.
Every field should have a getter and a setter.
All the methods of the class should be public unless there is a good reason to have otherwise (for example, helper methods need not be public).
Every class should be public.
Add comments to the class and methods except the getter and setter methods.
Follow the naming conventions for classes, fields, methods, objects, and variables (including constants).
