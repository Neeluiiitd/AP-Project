# Code Style Guidelines

The following guidelines should be followed when writing classes and methods in this project:

1. **Field Encapsulation**
   - All fields in a class should be declared as private unless there's a compelling reason to do otherwise.

2. **Getter and Setter Methods**
   - Every field should have a corresponding getter and setter method, allowing controlled access to the data.

3. **Method Accessibility**
   - All methods of a class should be declared as public unless they serve as internal helper methods or have specific reasons to be otherwise.

4. **Class Visibility**
   - Every class in the project should be declared as public to ensure it can be accessed when needed.

5. **Comments**
   - Add comments to classes and methods to provide meaningful descriptions and explanations of their purpose and functionality. Exclude comments for getter and setter methods unless they contain unique logic.

6. **Naming Conventions**
   - Follow established naming conventions for classes, fields, methods, objects, and variables, including constants. Consistency in naming enhances code readability and maintainability.

**JUnit tests should be included in your submission**
